# Weather Dashboard
## A dynamically operated weather dashboard 

I have created a weather dashboard where users can view live weather forecasts in the city of their choice.  UV index is color coded to indicate safe to harmful UV levels.  Recently viewed cities are saved for quick reference.   

## App Description:

The app was created with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, Moment.js, fontawesome.com, Adobe Fonts, Bootstrap, and OpenWeatherAPI.

## Preview

The following screenshot provides a preview of the website appearance:
