# Weather Dashboard
## A dynamically operated weather dashboard for my favorite cities

I have created a weather dashboar where users can view live weather forecasts in the city of their choice.  Recently viewed cities are saved for quick reference.   

## App Description:

The app was created with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, Moment.js, fontawesome.com, Bootstrap, and OpenWeatherAPI.

## Preview

The following screenshot provides a preview of the website appearance:
